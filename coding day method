//Static block and Constructor:-
* For every class there will be a constructor
* Constructor are used to initialize the object,for every class there will  be a default constructor whenever we create object constructor will be called then object will be created.
* Constructor having class properties and method properties.
//EXAMPLE:-
Static Block:
             public class q2{
               public static void main(string[]args){
                    Demo d1 = new Demo();
                    Demo d2 = new Demo();
                 }
}
class Demo{
   static{
        system.out.println("Static Block");
    }
  Demo() {
      System.out.println("Construction");
   }
***************************************************
//Static block :-
*Static block will be ceated with the static keyword it will call automatically no need to call with either object or class
//Static Method:-
*For static method no need to call with object we can directly call with  class name and here static will add class instance or objects
